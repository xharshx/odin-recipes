      <li>Ghee</li>
      <li>Spices and Herbs</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse 1 cup tuvar dal or arhar dal (split & husked pigeon pea lentils)
        for a couple of times in water. Add them to a 3 litre pressure cooker.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ½ cup chopped onions, 1 cup finely chopped tomatoes, 1 or 2 green
        chilies (1 teaspoon of chopped Anaheim pepper or Serrano pepper can be
        subbed for green chillies) and 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 2.5 cups of water. If cooking in a pot, then about 4 to 4.5 cups of
        water can be added.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ½ turmeric powder and 1 pinch of asafoetida (hing). If you do not
        have asafoetida, then skip it.
      </li>
      <li>Mix Well</li>
      <li>
        Pressure cook the lentils for about 7 to 8 whistles or more till they
        become soft and creamy. Mash the cooked lentils with a wired whisk or
        with a spoon and keep aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the desired consistency is reached, add 1 to 2 tablespoons low-fat
        cream (optional), ½ teaspoon garam masala powder, 2 tablespoons chopped
        coriander leaves (cilantro) and salt as per paste. Switch off the the
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix well so that everything combines uniformly. Check the salt before
        you add the tempering. If the salt is less than add more salt to the
        dal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next heat 3 tablespoons oil or ghee (clarified butter) in a small pan.
        First, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and crackle them. The cumin should get
        fried and not be raw, but don’t burn them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add 2 to 3 dry red chilies, a generous pinch of asafoetida and 5 to
        6 medium sized garlic cloves which have been finely chopped. Let the
        garlic brown and the red chilies change color. Do not burn the garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly add 1 teaspoon crushed kasuri methi and ½ teaspoon red chili
        powder or cayenne pepper. Mix and switch off the stove. Make sure to fry
        the tempering ingredients at a low flame, so that you don’t burn them.
      </li>
      <li>Pour entire tempering along with the oil or ghee into the dal.</li>
      <li>
        You can mix the dal with tempering or serve the dal tadka with the
        tempering on top it. Garnish with coriander leaves. Serve it hot with
        steamed basmati rice, cumin rice or with Indian flatbread like roti or
        paratha or chapati or naan.
      </li>
